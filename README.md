### Automate the Boring Stuff using Automata
Every member of the club is engaged in different activities and tracking their work each day, becomes a necessity. Status update is the solution to it. 
Though there is a status update reporting system enforced in the club, many of the members do not send their status updates on time or regularly. 
#### What is the issue:
1. The limit of the thread creation i.e the status update thread is created at 6:00 p.m.and the member has to wait for the thread generation and then only every person thinks about writing the update.
2. The member would have forget to do it (mostly the case).
3. No specific tracking of the status update history after a month.

#### What can be done to make them send status updates?
The problem have to be solved by making them regular to the status update.
The whole process of sending the status can be made more automated by using To-Do-List.
Every person may keep the to-do-list for keeping the track of his work. The same tracking space can automate the process of sending the status update manually each day.
The project aims the user to just update the To-Do-List, once the task is done. At the end of the day when the user runs the script the draft is automatically generated from the To-Do-List for that particaular day and is sent to the amFoss thread.
This whole process also works in situations when you don't have laptops or lack of good.
